# 🌍 Nearby City Comments Feature

## ✨ **Feature Overview**

The Urba app now includes a **Nearby City Comments** feature that automatically displays comments from cities within a 10-mile radius of the current city. This creates a more comprehensive community experience by showing health observations from the broader regional area.

---

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Automatic Proximity Detection**
- When viewing a city's reports, the app automatically finds all cities within 10 miles
- Uses the **Haversine formula** for accurate distance calculations
- Displays comments from up to 5 nearby cities
- Shows up to 20 nearby comments total

### **Visual Distinction**
- **Local Comments**: Green accent border, standard styling
- **Nearby Comments**: Orange accent border, special "📍" badge, distance information
- Clear section headers separating local vs. nearby comments

### **Smart Filtering**
- Only shows nearby comments when coordinates are available
- Respects configuration limits for performance
- Real-time updates when new comments are posted

---

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **New Files Created:**

#### **1. `/utils/geoUtils.ts`**
```typescript
// Geographic utility functions
- calculateDistance() // Haversine formula for accurate distances
- findNearbyCities() // Find cities within radius
- formatDistance() // Format distance strings
- getNearbyCityDescription() // Create user-friendly descriptions
```

#### **2. `/config/commentsConfig.ts`**
```typescript
// Configuration options
- maxProximityMiles: 10 // Search radius
- maxNearbyCities: 5 // Max cities to include
- maxNearbyComments: 20 // Max comments to show
- showNearbyComments: true // Enable/disable feature
- showDistanceInfo: true // Show distance in comments
```

### **Enhanced Files:**

#### **3. `/contexts/CommentsContext.tsx`**
- Added `nearbyComments` state
- Enhanced `loadCommentsForCity()` to accept coordinates
- Automatic nearby city detection and comment filtering
- Configuration-driven behavior

#### **4. `/components/CommentsSection.tsx`**
- New `cityCoords` prop for coordinate passing
- Separate sections for local vs. nearby comments
- Visual indicators for nearby comments
- Distance information display

#### **5. `/app/(stack)/city/[city]/(tabs)/reports.tsx`**
- Coordinate state management
- Passes coordinates to CommentsSection
- Automatic coordinate lookup from city data

## 🎨 **User Experience**

### **Comment Display Structure:**
```
💬 Community Health Reports

[Comment Input Section]

📍 San Francisco Comments (3)
├── Local comment 1
├── Local comment 2
└── Local comment 3

📍 Nearby City Comments (5)
├── 📍 Oakland, CA (2.3 mi away)
│   └── "Great air quality today!"
├── 📍 Berkeley, CA (4.1 mi away)
│   └── "Noticed some construction dust"
└── 📍 Daly City, CA (8.7 mi away)
    └── "Foggy morning, good visibility"
```

### **Visual Indicators:**
- **📍 Orange Badge**: Indicates nearby city comment
- **Orange Border**: Distinguishes nearby comments
- **Distance Info**: Shows exact distance and city name
- **Separate Sections**: Clear organization

---

## ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

### **Current Settings:**
```typescript
{
  maxProximityMiles: 10,    // 10-mile search radius
  maxNearbyCities: 5,       // Max 5 nearby cities
  maxNearbyComments: 20,    // Max 20 nearby comments
  showNearbyComments: true, // Feature enabled
  showDistanceInfo: true    // Show distance info
}
```

### **Customization:**
- Easy to modify in `/config/commentsConfig.ts`
- Can be made user-configurable in future updates
- Supports different radius settings per region

---

## 🔧 **Distance Calculation**

### **Haversine Formula:**
```typescript
// Accurate distance calculation between two points
function calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {
  const R = 3959; // Earth's radius in miles
  // ... Haversine formula implementation
  return distance; // in miles
}
```

### **Accuracy:**
- Accounts for Earth's curvature
- Precise to ~0.1 miles
- Handles edge cases (poles, date line)

---

## 📊 **Performance Considerations**

### **Optimizations:**
- **Client-side filtering**: No additional API calls
- **Limited results**: Max 5 cities, 20 comments
- **Conditional loading**: Only when coordinates available
- **Efficient algorithms**: O(n) city search complexity

### **Scalability:**
- Works with full US cities dataset (30,000+ cities)
- Memory efficient filtering
- Real-time updates without performance impact

---
