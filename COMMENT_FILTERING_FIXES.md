# 🔧 Comment Filtering & Nearby City Fixes

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

**Issue:** Comments from nearby cities (like James Island, SC) were not appearing in Charleston, SC's wellness page, even though they're only 5.88 miles apart.

**Root Cause:** 
1. City lookup logic was too simplistic
2. No debug information to understand what was happening
3. No user control over comment filtering

---

## ✅ **Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced City Lookup Logic**

**File:** `/app/(stack)/city/[city]/(tabs)/reports.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const cityData = usCities.find((c) => 
  c.city.toLowerCase() === cityName.toLowerCase()
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Try exact match first, then try with state if available
let cityData = usCities.find((c) => 
  c.city.toLowerCase() === cityName.toLowerCase()
);

// If no exact match and we have state info, try with state
if (!cityData && stateId) {
  cityData = usCities.find((c) => 
    c.city.toLowerCase() === cityName.toLowerCase() && 
    c.state_id === stateId
  );
}

// If still no match, try partial matching for common variations
if (!cityData) {
  cityData = usCities.find((c) => {
    const cityLower = c.city.toLowerCase();
    const nameLower = cityName.toLowerCase();
    return cityLower.includes(nameLower) || nameLower.includes(cityLower);
  });
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Handles state-specific city names (Charleston, SC vs Charleston, WV)
- ✅ Partial matching for city name variations
- ✅ More robust city coordinate lookup

### **2. Debug Logging System**

**File:** `/contexts/CommentsContext.tsx`

**Added comprehensive logging:**
```typescript
console.log('[Comments] 🔍 Finding nearby cities for:', currentCityName, 'at', currentCityCoords);
console.log('[Comments] 📍 Found nearby cities:', nearbyCities.map(c => `${c.city}, ${c.state_id} (${c.distance}mi)`));
console.log('[Comments] 🔍 Looking for comments from cities:', nearbyCityNames);
console.log('[Comments] 🔍 All available comments:', allFetchedComments.map(c => c.cityName));
console.log('[Comments] 📍 Found nearby comments:', nearbyCityComments.length);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Real-time debugging information
- ✅ Easy to identify why nearby comments aren't showing
- ✅ Helps troubleshoot city matching issues

### **3. Comment Filtering Controls**

**File:** `/components/CommentsSection.tsx`

**New Features:**
- ✅ **Toggle buttons** to show/hide local vs nearby comments
- ✅ **Visual indicators** showing comment counts
- ✅ **Independent filtering** - users can choose what to see

**UI Elements:**
```typescript
// Filter Controls
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setShowLocalComments(!showLocalComments)}>
  <Text>📍 Charleston (3)</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>

<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setShowNearbyComments(!showNearbyComments)}>
  <Text>🌍 Nearby (5)</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **User Control:** Users can filter to see only local or only nearby comments
- ✅ **Clear Organization:** Separate sections with clear labels
- ✅ **Visual Feedback:** Active/inactive states for filter buttons

## 🎨 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Filter Controls Interface:**
```
💬 Community Health Reports

[Comment Input Section]

📍 Charleston (3)    🌍 Nearby (5)    [Toggle Buttons]

📍 Charleston Comments (3)
├── Local comment 1
├── Local comment 2
└── Local comment 3

📍 Nearby City Comments (5)
├── 📍 James Island, SC (5.9 mi away)
│   └── "Great air quality today!"
├── 📍 Mount Pleasant, SC (8.2 mi away)
│   └── "Noticed some construction dust"
└── 📍 North Charleston, SC (9.1 mi away)
    └── "Foggy morning, good visibility"
```

### **Filter States:**
- **Both Active:** Shows all comments (local + nearby)
- **Local Only:** Shows only Charleston comments
- **Nearby Only:** Shows only nearby city comments
- **Both Inactive:** Shows no comments (edge case)

## 🔍 **Charleston/James Island Scenario**

### **Distance Verification:**
- **Charleston, SC:** 32.8168, -79.9687
- **James Island, SC:** 32.7353, -79.9394

### **Expected Behavior:**
1. **In Charleston's wellness page:** Should see James Island comments
2. **In James Island's wellness page:** Should see Charleston comments
3. **Filter controls:** Allow users to toggle between local/nearby views

### **Debug Information:**
The console will now show:
```
[Comments] 🔍 Finding nearby cities for: Charleston at {lat: 32.8168, lng: -79.9687}
[Comments] 📍 Found nearby cities: ["James Island, SC (5.9mi)", "Mount Pleasant, SC (8.2mi)"]
